Firstly, i made sure node.js and npm were installed
Then i installed Sass with the command line "npm install -g sass"
To verify the installation i typed sass --version
To install localy as a dev-dependency i used "npm install --save-dev sass"
Then i added scripts to my package.json 
"scripts": {
    "build:css": "sass src/styles.scss dist/styles.css --no-source-map",
    "watch:css": "sass -- watch src/styles.scss:dist/styles.css"
  }
